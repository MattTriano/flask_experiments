Flask configuration steps

to use 
	>flask run
to start an app, you have to tell the system which app to pass to flask, and this is done (on Windows) with the command
	>set FLASK_APP=<app_name>.py
where <app_name> is, replaced with the actual name of the app you want to run.


To use debug mode (which also makes the server automatically update any time the source code changes),
	>set FLASK_DEBUG=1
